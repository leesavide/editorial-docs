Set File Contents
=================

*Sets the text contents of a file in the document library*

If you want to modify the file that you're currently editing, it is usually better to use a :ref:`workflow-action-replace-selected-text` action, possibly in combination with an :ref:`workflow-action-extend-selection` action that selects all text.

* **Input:** Can be used as a variable in the `New Text` parameter
* **Output:** The text that was saved to the file

Parameters
----------

* **File Name:** The name of the file that you want to write -- this can include a relative folder path.
* **In Dropbox:** When set to `on`, the file name is looked for in Dropbox.
* **New Text:** The text that should be saved to the file
* **If File Does Not Exist:** Specifies the behavior in case a file with the given name doesn't exist. By default, the file is created.
