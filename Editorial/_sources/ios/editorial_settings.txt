You can access Editorialâ€™s settings from the file browser, using the "gear" button.

Dropbox
^^^^^^^

If you haven't already linked Editorial to your Dropbox account, you can do this from here. When your account is linked, additional settings will appear:

* **Unlink Dropbox** -- Logs you out of Dropbox and removes all synced files from Editorial.

* **Sync Folder** -- By default, Editorial syncs with the folder `/Apps/Editorial` in your Dropbox. If you have an existing folder of plain text notes, or want to share the folder with a different app, you can change it here.

  If your sync folder contains subfolders, you have to open them in the file browser at least once, in order to sync them automatically afterwards. This is to avoid downloading files that you don't actually need.

* **Advanced**
    * **Reset Sync** -- Removes all synced files from your device, and starts downloading fresh copies from Dropbox. You can try this if you're experiencing problems with the synchronization.
    * **Additional Extensions** -- By default, only plain text files are downloaded from Dropbox automatically. Other files are shown in the list, but you have to download them manually. When you add file extensions here (e.g. jpg or png), files with those extensions will also be downloaded automatically, which can make the synchronization slower.
    * **Show Deleted Files...** -- When Editorial detects the deletion of a file that was downloaded from Dropbox before, the local copy is moved to a special *Trash* folder. You can use this option to reveal that folder. Please note that this only shows files that were removed *automatically*, not those you deleted explicitly within Editorial.

General
^^^^^^^

* **Dark Theme** -- Turn this on if you prefer to work in a dark environment.
* **Gestures**
    * **Panel Gestures** -- This controls how the swipe gestures for switching between different panels work. By default, you can use them everywhere on the screen, but if you find yourself accidentally switching between panels (e.g. while selecting text), you might prefer if they're only triggered when swiping from the left and right screen edges.
    * **'Hide Keyboard' Button** (iPhone only) -- By default, you can dismiss the on-screen keyboard with a downward swipe gesture in the editor. By enabling this setting, you can dismiss the keyboard with a button instead.
    
* **File Settings**
    * **Creating New Files** (Show Template Picker / Use Default Template) -- By default, Editorial shows the document template picker when you tap the **+** button in the file browser. If you typically only use one template/file format, you can set this to *Use Default Template* to skip the picker. You can still show the template picker by holding the **+** button in this case.
    * **Reset File Extensions...** -- Resets the associations of file extensions and syntax highlighting modes. When you pick a different mode for the current document (via quick settings), that mode is remembered for all files with the same extension. The same applies if you use the "Edit as Text" option after opening a file with an unknown extension.
    * **Fuzzy Search in Filenames** -- This changes the behavior of the search bar in the file browser. When *fuzzy search* is enabled, you can search for non-contiguous sequences of characters, e.g. searching for "wte" would also find "**W**elcome **t**o **E**ditorial".
    
* **Browser**
    * **External Browser** -- If you have third-party browsers installed (e.g. Chrome, iCab...), you can choose to use it instead of Safari here.
    * **Open Editor/Preview Links in...** -- When you tap on a link in the editor or Markdown preview, you can choose to open it either in the in-app browser (default), or an external browser (the one you selected above).
    * **Clear Cache** -- Deletes the cache of the in-app browser
    * **Delete All Cookies** -- Deletes all cookies that were stored by the in-app browser (this will also log you out of websites)

Editor
^^^^^^

* **General**
    * **Line Spacing** -- Controls the text editor's line spacing for all documents
    * **Text Width** -- Controls the text editor's margins
    * **Live Word Count** -- When turned on, you can see the word count while you're writing (in the top-right corner).
    * **Folding** -- When folding is enabled, you can hide the contents of a section/project by tapping on the triangle next to the header. Note that some workflows may still fold text, even if it's disabled here.
    * **Automatic Character Pairs** -- By default, Editorial automatically inserts closing parentheses etc. You can turn this off here.
    * **Check Spelling** -- When turned on, misspelled words are underlined in red
    * **Auto-Correction** -- Controls the on-screen keyboard's auto-correction
    * **Auto-Capitalization** -- Controls whether the shift key should be activated automatically
* **Markdown** -- These settings affect the editor's *Markdown* mode (see also: :ref:`Writing Markdown <editorial-writing-markdown>`)
    * **Text Font** -- The font for regular paragraph text
    * **Heading Font** -- The fonts for different heading levels
    * **Code Font** -- The font for code blocks (for inline code, only the font face is used with the regular paragraph text font size)
    * **HTML Preview** -- This section controls various options for Markdown variants in the HTML preview (see also: :ref:`Supported Markdown Extensions <editorial-markdown-extensions>`)
* **Plain Text**
    * **Text Font** -- The font to use for plain text documents (anything that isn't treated as Markdown, TaskPaper, or Fountain)
* **TaskPaper** (see also: :ref:`Writing Todo Lists <editorial-writing-todo-lists>`)
    * **Color Labels** -- You can associate important tags (e.g. ``@today``) with colors to make them stand out in the editor (see also: :ref:`Color Labels <editorial-taskpaper-color-labels>`)
    * **Show Checkboxes** -- By default, Editorial shows dashes in TaskPaper documents as checkboxes that you can tap to mark a task as done. If you prefer to add ``@done`` tags manually, you can turn this off.
    * **Show Drag Handles** -- Controls whether you can move tasks and projects by dragging the right margin (see also: :ref:`Moving Tasks <editorial-taskpaper-moving-tasks>`)
    * **Strike-out @done Tasks** -- When enabled, tasks that are tagged with ``@done`` are struck out.
    * **Add Date to @done Tasks** -- When you tap a checkbox, the current date is automatically added to the ``@done`` tag. You can turn this off here.
* **Fountain**
    * **Text Font** -- The base font to use for Fountain documents

Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

* **Restore Default Workflows & Snippets...** -- Restores the default workflows and snippets that come with Editorial. This will *not* delete any of your own workflows, but it will overwrite changes you made to the built-in ones.
* **Shared Workflows** -- Shows a list of workflows that you've shared online.
* **Snippets & Abbreviations** (see also: :ref:`Using Snippets <editorial-snippets>`)
    * **Ignore Case** -- When enabled, the case of snippet and workflow abbreviations is ignored, e.g. the abbreviation "ffd" is also triggered by typing "FFd".
    * **Sound Effects** -- Enables or disables the sound effect that is played when a snippet is expanded
    * **Suggest Completions...** -- Controls when/if to show completion suggestions for partially-typed abbreviations. By default, suggestions are shown after typing two characters of an abbreviation, which is a good compromise between being helpful and distracting. You might want to turn this off entirely if you use TextExpander snippets for correcting typos (in that case, a lot of suggestions would otherwise pop up while you type).
