Release Notes
==============

This page contains detailed information about new features and other improvements in new versions of the app.

Version 1.3
-----------

* Support for split-screen multi-tasking on iPad Air 2 and later.

* Support for the larger screen size of the 12" iPad Pro.

* The workflow editor has moved to the accessory panel, and the script/UI editors are opened in separate tabs.

* Updated Python interpreter to 2.7.12.

* Various improvements and new capabilities in the :mod:`photos`, :mod:`sound`, and :mod:`speech` Python modules.

* Fixed a couple of UI readability issues in the dark theme.

Version 1.2
-----------

General
^^^^^^^

* **Folding** for Markdown sections and TaskPaper projects – this allows you to hide the contents of a section/project by tapping the triangle next to the header (in the left margin). For Markdown documents, the header level (number of '#'s) determines how much text is folded (e.g. folding a level-1 header also folds any level-2 headers below it, up to the next level-1 header). You can quickly unfold all text in the current document by tapping the triangle button in the top-left corner.

  The label next to a folded header shows the word count (Markdown) or number of tasks (TaskPaper) in the hidden text.

  Using the new `Fold Text`, `Unfold All Text`, and `Fold Lines Containing...` actions, you can also fold text from your own workflows. The :mod:`editor` Python module also has a few new functions to work with folded text.

* **Quick settings** – by tapping the "Aa" button (main toolbar on iPad and iPhone 6 Plus, in the outline popup on other iPhones), you can now change editor-related settings more quickly. This includes a new "Text Zoom" setting that greatly simplifies changing the overall font size.

  You can also change the syntax highlighting mode from the quick settings. The selected mode becomes the default for all documents with the same file extension, which makes the various confusing file extension settings of previous versions obsolete.
    
  If you primarily type with an external Bluetooth keyboard, you can also disable the extra on-screen keyboard row from the quick settings.

* There's a new "**Arrange Paragraphs**" mode that you can turn on from the quick settings as well. When it's enabled, drag handles are shown for every line, basically like in TaskPaper mode, but this works for Markdown and plain text. This can be particularly useful in combination with folding because when you drag a section that's folded, the entire contents moves with the header.

* **Document templates** -- Significantly improved *New File* menu with customizable templates and the ability to import photos from the camera roll.

  Document templates are essentially workflows that contain a single "Create Document" action by default. This allows you to set the initial content, filename and selection range/cursor position of a new document. Filename and content can contain variables, so it's possible to include the current date, clipboard, etc., similar to snippets. But since templates are full-fledged workflows, you can do a lot more with them, e.g. show a dialog before creating the document, use the selected text in the current document to create a new one, etc.

* Improved support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus

* Improved in-editor search – on the iPad, there are a couple of new options for replacing occurrences, matching only full words, etc., and the highlighting of search results looks better.

* There's a new "**Highlight All**" menu item when you select a word or sentence. This basically applies the selected word as a search term, but without showing the search bar. In addition to ad-hoc searches, you can also use this for things like highlighting the current sentence while you scroll around in a document, so you can find your way back more easily.

* **Browser tabs** -- The accessory panel has a completely new, much more flexible tab UI. In its default state, only the Markdown preview is shown, but you can add the console, documentation, and browser as tabs when you need them. I wanted to reduce the visual clutter, and I'm pretty sure that most people use the help and console tabs rarely, if ever (they're still there of course, you can get to them from an empty browser tab).

  There can be multiple browser tabs, and you can open links in new tabs via tap-and-hold. The "Open URL" action also has new options for controlling in which tab a page is opened. By default, pages are opened the last-used browser tab, but you can change this to either *always* open a new tab, or to use a tab with a given ID (so that URLs from one workflow always open in the same tab...).

* New share button in browser tabs; the share button in the Preview tab also uses the system share sheet now, so you can send the HTML to app extensions you may have installed.

* 1Password support in the web browser

* HTML/CSS editing with basic syntax highlighting – this is primarily intended to make editing custom preview templates more convenient.

* Improved auto-pairing for quotation marks, including curly quotes (on the iPad, curly quotes can now be accessed by tapping and holding the ``"`` key).

* Indentation can be changed more easily for multiple paragraphs ("Indent" item in editing menu).

* The editor now remembers the scroll position and folding state of recent files.

* On the iPhone, the on-screen keyboard can now be dismissed by swiping down in the editor -- if you prefer to use a button for this, there is an option to disable it in the `Gestures` settings.

* New "Edit as Text" option when you open a text file with an unknown extension. When you do this once, the extension will be remembered automatically. You can restore the default behavior in the new "File Settings" section.

* Improved support for third-party web browsers. In addition to Chrome and iCab, you can now select Opera Mini, Coast, and Mercury. You can also choose to open links from the editor and preview in these app (instead of the in-app browser). If you select Chrome as the external browser, a "back to Editorial" button is now shown by default (you can disable this in the settings).

Markdown Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `CriticMarkup <http://criticmarkup.com>`_ syntax highlighting  

* Multiple **Markdown preview themes** – tap on the title of the preview tab to switch between them (and add your own)

* The Markdown preview is now also shown in plain text mode (so you can use plain text mode as a way to turn off syntax highlighting, but still keep the preview).  

* Syntax highlighting support for the ~~strike-out~~ Markdown extension  

* Improved support for fenced code blocks  

TaskPaper Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Checkboxes in TaskPaper mode** are now also available on the iPhone.

* New setting to turn off automatic completion dates when marking tasks as @done.

* Color labels are now applied according to the order of tags in the text (previously, each color had a fixed priority).

* The behavior of the "gray" TaskPaper color label has changed: Instead of using a gray background/border, tasks with this label are now dimmed, similar to notes and done tasks.


Fountain Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* This mode is completely new -- it allows you to edit screenplays in `Fountain <http://fountain.io>`_ format with syntax highlighting and an HTML preview (including page numbers). The document outline shows a list of all scenes in the document.

Workflows / Scripting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* New interactive workflow building tutorial (accessible from an empty workflow).

* New "Generate PDF Document" action – the source can be HTML (perhaps generated from Markdown) or a web page (URL). It supports A4 and Letter format with customizable page margins (defined in a CSS-like format). The output of the action is a file:// URL that can be fed directly into an "Open URL" action to show the result in a browser tab.

* New "Fold Text" and "Unfold All Text" actions. The placeholder for the folded text can show a custom label. Note that unlike the built-in folding for headers, you're not limited to folding entire paragraps – it's possible to fold anywhere within the document (though unfolding won't be animated in this case). The triangle buttons on the margin are not shown for text that is folded using this action; to unfold, you have to tap on the placeholder instead.

* Renamed "Search in Editor" action to "Highlight Occurrences" with a new option to highlight matches of a regular expression (due to the way the results are updated live as you type, matches cannot span multiple lines/paragraphs though). The search bar is no longer shown when this action is executed.

* The mini Python editor is now more similar in behavior to the big one – in particular, it supports auto-pairing parentheses, auto-indentation, slightly more advanced syntax highlighting (with support for triple-quoted strings), etc.

* New "Share Text or URL" action -- this allows you to show the iOS share sheet for a piece of text that can optionally be interpreted as a URL (which enables different extensions/apps).

* New :mod:`twitter` module for accessing iOS Twitter accounts, and using the Twitter API

* New :mod:`reminders` module for accessing the iOS Reminders database. You can create location- or time-based reminders, mark existing reminders as completed, etc.

* New :mod:`dialogs` module with some easy-to-use functions for simple data entry dialogs (as an alternative to the :mod:`ui` module for simple tasks)

* The `editor` module has a couple of new functions: :func:`editor.get_scroll_position`, :func:`editor.set_scroll_position`, :func:`editor.fold_range`, :func:`editor.unfold_range`, :func:`editor.unfold_all`, :func:`editor.get_selected_folder`

* The ``screenplain`` Python module is included for converting Fountain documents to HTML or PDF

* When you copy a workflow to the clipboard (from the workflow editor's "share" menu or the workflow details), the workflow is now copied as an editorial:// URL that is suitable for adding the workflow from anywhere (e.g. for sharing workflows without using the official workflow directory)

* New built-in "Syntax Mode" variable for workflows (e.g. useful to check if the current document is Markdown, regardless of the file extension)

* New ``editorial-http`` and ``editorial-https`` URL schemes for opening web pages in the Editorial browser more easily (without requiring a workflow)

Misc
^^^^

* Some UI changes in the file browser: The root view now shows recent files and list entries for "Local Files" and "Dropbox". The title bar of folder views contains a persistent search bar instead of the mode switching control. The file browser also remembers the previously selected folder when you restart the app now.

* The preview panel now keeps its scroll position when it's refreshed after you edit the document.

* The setting to turn off Markdown syntax highlighting is gone (you can switch to plain text mode instead), and the ability to change the syntax mode directly from the editor also made the file extension settings obsolete.

* Improved scrolling behavior when you select a header from the document outline.

* Scrolling in the workflow icon picker should be much smoother 

* Improved performance for live word count and the text selection loupe

* Significantly improved accessibility via VoiceOver

* nvALT "Notes & Settings" files are now hidden in the file browser.

* New options to clear cookies and cache of the in-app browser (in settings)


Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

* Fixed several hard-to-read (white on white) action sheets in dark mode on iOS 8

* Fixed a nasty crash-on-launch when the clipboard happened to contain certain kinds of JSON data.

* Emphasis (italic) for single characters should be syntax-highlighted correctly now.

Version 1.1.1
-------------

General
^^^^^^^

* New setting to specify additional file extensions that should be downloaded automatically from Dropbox (e.g. images).

* In the iPhone version, you can now check off tasks in TaskPaper documents more quickly: Just grab the gray handle (right margin), and drag it to the left (this also works on iPad if checkboxes are disabled in the settings).

* Script actions now use the first comment in the script that isn't a shebang or coding directive as their subtitle.

* Browser bookmarks can now be reordered on iPhone.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

* Fixed an issue with TextExpander snippets not being updated correctly.

* Fixed embedded (ui action) workflows not being saved on iPhone

* Fixed crash when using "Variable…" menu in single-line text fields on iPhone

* Fixed a couple of bugs in the ``ui`` module (``SegmentedControl.segments`` returned incorrect values, ``WebView.load_url`` and ``WebView.load_html`` converted all input to lowercase for no reason, setting ``TableView.selected_row`` didn't work correctly).

* Improved support for (hardware) keyboard shortcuts – the following shortcuts are built-in:

  - Cmd+J – Toggle between accessories panel and editor

  - Cmd+F – Toggle in-editor search

  - Cmd+G / Cmd+Shift+G – Show prev./next search result in editor

Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

* New bundled workflows: Print, Speak Selection, Lorem Ipsum, Calculator (iPad only).

* Improved integration with the workflow directory – you can view all workflows that you've previously shared from the settings and sharing a workflow again gives you an option to update the existing workflow instead of creating a new link.

* If you have a lot of workflows, you can now tag them and filter the list by tag (the tag filter bar will automatically appear when you add the first tag).

* Workflow actions can have color labels.

Python
^^^^^^

* New :mod:`ui` module to create native user interfaces from Python. This is complemented by a new UI Editor that allows you to build UIs visually, so you don't have to write a lot of code to set things up. The UI Editor is available as a separate tab in the full script editor when using a :ref:`workflow-action-run-script` action. The UI editor is also used for the new "Custom UI" workflow action that allows you to create custom user interfaces for workflows, without writing any code.
