Fold Lines Containing...
========================

*Folds (hides) lines that contain a search term or pattern*

* **Input:** Can be used as a variable in the `Pattern` parameter
* **Output:** Same as input

Parameters
----------

* **Search Type:** How the search term is applied -- can be `Regular Expression`, `Case-insensitive` or `Case-sensitive`.
* **Pattern:** What to search for
* **Invert:** When enabled, lines that *don't* match the search term will be folded. This can be useful to "focus" on specific lines, e.g. you could hide everything that doesn't contain "@today" to focus on today's tasks.
