Sort Lines
=================

*Sorts the input lines alphabetically*

The sort order may not be `strictly` alphabetical in case the input contains numbers. A strict alphabetic sort order would sort "2" after "100", the sort algorithm that is used by this action sorts those similar to how a human would sort them ("100" after "2").

* **Input:** The lines to sort
* **Output:** The sorted lines

Parameters
----------

* **Sort Order:** Can be `Ascending` (A->Z) or `Descending` (Z->A)
