.. _workflow-action-run-script:

==================
Run Python Script
==================

*Runs a custom Python script that is directly editable in the workflow editor*

This action provides a way to combine the power of :ref:`Python <ios>` with the simplicity of workflows. It lets you perform more complex operations that might not be possible with any of the other actions.

For integration between scripts and other workflow actions, the :mod:`workflow` module provides functions to read and write variables, get the input (from the previous action), and set the output that is passed to the next action.

If an exception occurs while running the script, the workflow is stopped.

* **Input:** Can be used in the script via the :func:`workflow.get_input`
* **Output:** Can be set from the script with :func:`workflow.set_output`

Parameters
----------

* **Source Code:** The Python source code of the script -- Tap the `Full Editor` button to switch to a full-screen code editor with additional features (e.g. code completion).
