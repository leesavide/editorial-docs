.. _workflow-action-move-caret:

================
Move Caret
================

*Moves the insertion caret in the text editor*

This action is similar to the :ref:`workflow-action-extend-selection` action, but the result is always an empty selection.

* **Input:** Any
* **Output:** Same as input

Parameters
----------

* **Direction:** The direction in which the caret is moved. Can be `Backward` or `Forward`. If text is selected, `forward` moves the caret from the `end` of that selection and `backward` from the `start`. Additionally, you can specify how far the caret should be moved. This can be the start/end of the document, the start/end of selected line(s) or a number of characters.
   
* **Number of Characters:** If the `number of characters` option is used above, this parameter specifies by how many characters the caret should be moved. This field can contain either a plain number, or a mathematical expression like ``5 + 2``. You can also use variables here. If the number is negative, this has the same effect as using the opposite direction with a positive number.
