.. _workflow-action-select-range:

=================
Select Range
=================

*Selects an absolute character range in the editor*

The `Range` parameter is given as two numbers in the form ``from:to`` (note the colon between the values). The first character in the document has the index zero. As an example, ``0:3`` would select the first 3 characters. Optionally, the range can be interpreted relative to the currently selected range.

Negative values can be used to "anchor" the selection at the end of the document/selection (e.g. to select the last `x` characters, regardless of how long the document is).

One of the values can be left empty to extend the selection to the start/end of the document (the colon still has to be included though).

Examples:

* ``0:3`` -- Select the first three characters
* ``:3`` -- Same as above (if the `from` component is zero, it can be left out)
* ``3:`` -- Select everything `except for` the first three characters (starting from the fourth)
* ``-10:`` -- Select the `last` 10 characters
* ``10:-10`` -- Select everything except for the first ten `and` the last ten characters (note that the `to` component is negative)

Input/Output:

* **Input:** Can be used as a variable in the `Range` parameter
* **Output:** The text in the selected range

Parameters
----------

* **Range (from:to):** The range to select, see above for examples
* **Relative to:** How to interpret the given range. `Current Selection` means that the first character in the current selection has an index of zero, regardless of where it appears in the entire document.
