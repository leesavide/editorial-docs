.. _workflow-action-open-url:

=================
Open URL
=================

*Opens a URL in a web browser or other app*

The URL can be opened either in the built-in web browser or in Safari / a different app. The built-in web browser and Safari can open http and https URLs, for other URL schemes, third-party apps may be opened if installed. If the URL is invalid or no app can be found to open it, the workflow stops with an error.

When you activate the [%] button next to the URL, any workflow variables that are part of the URL will automatically be URL-escaped, so that you can construct a query string from variables without having to use a separate :ref:`workflow-action-url-escape` action for each variable.

* **Input:** Can be used in the `URL` parameter
* **Output:** The URL that was opened

Parameters
----------

* **Open in:** Can be `In-App Browser` or `Safari/Other App`. The in-app browser can only open http, https, or file URLs.
* **URL:** The URL to open -- it can contain variable placeholders, this is especially useful in combination with the :ref:`workflow-action-url-escape` and :ref:`workflow-action-set-variable` actions.
* **Wait until Loaded:** If set to `on`, the next action is only run after the page has completed loading (only applies if `In-App Browser` is selected above). This is recommended if you add a :ref:`workflow-action-evaluate-javascript` action afterwards.
