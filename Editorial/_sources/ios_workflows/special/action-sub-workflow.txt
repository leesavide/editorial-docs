Sub-Workflow

*Runs an embedded workflow with the given input*

A sub-workflow allows you to run a different workflow within the current one. The workflow can either be embedded as a copy of an existing workflow, or referenced by name. The sub-workflow action waits until the sub-workflow has finished executing.

* **Input:** Will be passed to the first action in the sub-workflow
* **Output:** Set by the last action in the sub-worfklow

Parameters
----------

* **Can Stop Main Workflow:** When this is enabled, stopping the sub-workflow (e.g. by cancelling an action) will also stop the main workflow. Otherwise, only the sub-workflow is stopped, but the main workflow continues after the current sub-workflow action.
