Extract Range
=================

*Extracts a given range of characters from the input text*

The `Range` parameter is given as two numbers in the form ``from:to`` (note the colon between the values). The first character in the input text has the index zero. As an example, ``0:3`` would extract the first 3 characters.

Negative values can be used to "anchor" the selection at the end of the input (e.g. to extract the last `x` characters, regardless of how long the text is).

One of the values can be left empty to extend the selection to the start/end of the input (the colon still has to be included though).

The following examples use the input text "Hello World":

* ``0:3`` -- "Hel"
* ``:3`` -- Same as above (if the `from` component is zero, it can be left out)
* ``3:`` -- "lo World" (everything `except for` the first three characters)
* ``-5:`` -- "World" (note that the `from` component is a negative number, so the characters are counted from the end; the `to` component is left out, so the range extends to the end of the text)

Input/Output:

* **Input:** The text to extract the range from
* **Output:** The characters in the given range

Parameters
----------

* **Range (from:to):** The range to extract, see above for examples
