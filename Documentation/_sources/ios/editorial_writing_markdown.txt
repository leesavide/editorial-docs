Writing Markdown
----------------

Editorial is optimized for writing Markdown, a popular plain text format that is very readable, and works well for writing on the web.

In the words of `John Gruber <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown>`_, the inventor of Markdown:

   The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.

The following is just a quick overview of how you can format your text using Markdown. For all the details, please refer to the `syntax reference <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>`_ on the official Markdown project page.


.. _editorial_markdown_primer:

Markdown Primer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Paragraphs
""""""""""

Paragraphs in Markdown are separated by blank lines. A single line break does not result in a new paragraph.

Headers
""""""""""

Headers are marked with one or more hash characters. Example::

   # This is a Level 1 Heading
   
   ## This is a Level 2 Heading

Markdown also supports using "Setext-style" headers (underlining the header with ``===`` or ``---``), but this is currently not supported by Editorial's inline preview. It does work in the full HTML preview however.

Blockquotes
""""""""""""

Blockquotes are indicated by a leading ``>`` character, like in plain text email. Example::

   > Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent.
   > It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the
   > opposite direction.
   > – Albert Einstein

Lists
""""""""""

You can use asterisks, plus symbols or hyphens as list markers for unordered lists. Example::

   * Apple
   * Banana
   * Cherry

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods. Example::

   1. Red
   2. Green
   3. Blue

The actual numbers are not important for the output.

Code
""""""""""

Code blocks can be formatted by indenting a paragraph with 4 or more spaces (or one tab). Example::

   This is a normal paragraph.

       This is a code block.

The inline preview uses a ``monospace`` font for code blocks.

Inline code is enclosed in a pair of *backtick* characters. Example::

   You can use the `markdown` or `markdown2` modules to parse Markdown in Python.

Links
""""""""""

There are two styles of links in Markdown: *inline* and *reference*. The link text is always enclosed in square brackets. Inline links contain the URL in parentheses, directly after the title::

   [Inline Link](http://example.com)

A reference link uses a second set of square brackets and an arbitrary identifier instead of a URL. The identifier can be defined anywhere else in the document::

   [Reference Link][1]
   
   Some other text
   
   [1]: http://example.com

Emphasis
""""""""""

Markdown uses one, two, or three asterisks (*) or underscores (_) for emphasizing text. Example::

   *This is italic*
   **This is bold**
   ***This is bold and italic***

Images
""""""""""

Images have the same syntax as links, except that an exclamation mark is added. Example::

   ![Alt text](http://example.com/image.png)


.. _editorial-markdown-extensions:

Supported Markdown Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Editorial supports a couple of Markdown extensions ("dialects") in its HTML preview, some of which are also visible directly in the editor. In the :ref:`settings <editorial_settings>`, you can either turn on these extensions separately, or switch to Multi-Markdown mode, which supports most of the extensions out of the box.

Footnotes
"""""""""

Footnotes are very similar to reference links, i.e. the definition of a footnote is usually put at the bottom of the text or section.::

    This is a footnote[^1]
    
    ...Other text
    
    [^1]: Footnote definition

.. tip::
    If you use the default set of snippets, you can insert a footnote by typing ``ffn``, and a footnote definition with ``ffd``. Selecting a footnote in the editor also gives you an option to jump to the definition (Select "Go to Footnote" in the Copy/Paste menu).

Auto-Links
""""""""""

When enabled, things that look like URLs will be turned into clickable links, without having to be enclosed with angle brackets.

Strikethrough
"""""""""""""

Similar to ``**bold**`` and ``*italic*``, you can strike out text by surrounding it with two tilde characters on each side: ``~~example~~``

Superscript
"""""""""""

Tables
""""""

The syntax for tables basically looks like ASCII art::

    First Header  | Second Header | Third Header |
     ------------ | :-----------: | -----------: |
    Cell          |   *Cell*      |      Cell    |
    Cell          |   **Cell**    |      Cell    |

Table cells are separated by pipe (``|``) characters, the colons below the table headers indicate the column's alignment. See the `MultiMarkdown Syntax Guide <https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide>`_ for more details.

Smart Quotes
""""""""""""

When enabled, straight quotation marks are automatically converted to typographic (curly) quotation marks.

Metadata Headers
""""""""""""""""

To use metadata, simply add key-value pairs to the top of a Markdown file::

    Title:  My Article  
    Author: John Doe  
    Date:   July 25, 2005  

When the `Metadata Headers` option is enabled, these headers will not be visible in the HTML preview.


Folding Sections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can quickly hide the contents of a section by tapping the triangle next to the header.

When a section is folded, the number of hidden words is shown next to it. You can quickly unfold all sections by tapping the gray triangle in the top-left corner.

The header level (number of ``#``) determines how much is folded, e.g. folding a level-1 header also hides all level-2+ headers below it, up to the next level-1 header.

Tips
^^^^

* Some of the built-in snippets are very useful to make editing Markdown more efficient. For example, you can simply type ``llnk`` to insert a link with the cursor correctly positioned to write its title.
* If you paste a lot of text from the clipboard, try typing ``ppp`` instead of using the standard editing menu -- it can be a lot faster.
* When you select a footnote while editing, you can jump to its definition from the editing menu (if the definition doesn't exist yet, this is also a quick way of creating it).
* When you have a word selected and tap the ``*`` key, the text is automatically enclosed in a pair of asterisks (which makes it italic or bold) -- the same applies to parentheses.
* While editing lists, you might find the "Arrange Paragraphs" mode useful: It allows you to move lines via drag'n'drop -- you can enable this in the quick settings ("Aa" button).
