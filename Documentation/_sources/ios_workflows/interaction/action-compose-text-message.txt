====================
Compose Text Message
====================

*Opens a text message composition sheet*

You can set the initial message text and recipients (phone numbers or iMessage-enabled email addresses). The next action starts when the dialog is dismissed. By default, the workflow is stopped when the message is not sent (by canceling the dialog), but you can also continue the workflow in that case.

Even though initial values for the various parameters can be set, all of these can be changed manually before actually sending the message.

* **Input:** Can be used in the `Recipient(s)` and `Message Body` parameters
* **Output:** Same as input (note: it is technically not possible to get the contents of the message as it was actually sent)

Parameters
----------

* **Recipient(s):** One or more email addresses and/or phone numbers to send the message to. Email addresses and phone numbers are extracted from the given text automatically regardless of what other text might be around them.
* **Message Body:** The initial message text of the message
* **Stop if Canceled:** When enabled (the default), the workflow stops if the dialog is canceled. Otherwise, the workflow continues normally.
