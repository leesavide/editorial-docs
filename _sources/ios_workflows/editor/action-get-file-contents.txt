*Gets the text contents of a file in the document library*

To get the contents of the document that is currently open, it's usually better to use the :ref:`workflow-action-document-text` action.

* **Input:** N/A
* **Output:** The contents of the selected text file

Parameters
----------

* **File Name:** The name of the file that you want to read -- this can include a relative folder path.
* **In Dropbox:** When set to `on`, the file name is looked for in Dropbox. The file must already be downloaded.
* **If File Does Not Exist:** Specifies the behavior in case a file with the given name doesn't exist. Can be `Empty Output` or `Stop Workflow`. In the latter case, an error message is shown.
