.. _workflow-action-evaluate-javascript:

===================
Evaluate JavaScript
===================

*Evaluates a JavaScript snippet in the currently loaded web page*

The JavaScript is evaluated in the context of the currently loaded web page in the *browser* panel.

This could be used to modify the DOM of the loaded page or to extract information from it. If you combine it with an :ref:`workflow-action-open-url` action, it is strongly recommended that you set the *Wait until Loaded* parameter there.

* **Input:** N/A
* **Output:** The result of evaluating ``window.output`` after your code is run. Due to a limitation/bug in iOS, it's not possible to return the result of your script directly without potentially causing a deadlock situation (e.g. when using the blocking JavaScript ``alert()`` function)

Parameters
----------

* **Source:** The JavaScript code to run
