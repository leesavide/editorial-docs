.. _workflow-action-open-xcallback-url:

===================
Open x-callback URL
===================

*Opens an x-callback URL in a third-party app*

You can use this action to get results from other apps that implement the `x-callback-url <http://x-callback-url.com>`_ standard. An `x-callback URL <http://x-callback-url.com>`_ is basically a way to exchange data between cooperating apps on the same device.

An x-callback URL passes data to another app and asks it to perform some action. Additionally, it provides the other app with URLs that should be opened when the action succeeds, is cancelled, or produces an error. These *callbacks* are added to the URL automatically when you use this action. When the *success* callback is invoked by the other app, your workflow continues with the result of the action, otherwise, it is stopped.

When you activate the [%] button next to the URL, any workflow variables that are part of the URL will automatically be URL-escaped, so that you can construct a query string from variables without having to use a separate :ref:`workflow-action-url-escape` action for each variable.

* **Input:** Can be used in the `URL` parameter
* **Output:** The x-success URL that the other app called (or its first parameter in unescaped form)

Parameters
----------

* **URL:** The x-callback URL to open. It doesn't have to include the x-success, x-cancel or x-error parameters (these are added automatically).
* **x-success:** A custom x-success callback that is automatically included in the URL. It has to begin with "editorial://workflow-callback", but you can add extra parameters if the called app requires placeholders in the x-success URL to produce output (e.g. "editorial://workflow-callback?output=[[output]]").
* **Output:** The output of the action always depends on the x-success URL that the other app calls. By default, the first parameter of this URL is unescaped and passed to the next action. For example, if the x-success URL was "editorial://workflow-callback?output=foo%20bar", the next action would get "foo bar" as input. If the x-success URL includes more than one parameter, you might want to use the raw URL instead.
