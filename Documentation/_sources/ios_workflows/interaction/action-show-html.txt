Show HTML

*Shows custom HTML in the preview panel*

This action allows you to use the *Preview* accessory panel to show your own custom HTML/CSS. When custom HTML is shown, the panel contains an additional `Done` button that switches back to the default Markdown preview.

* **Input:** Can be used as a variable in the `HTML` parameter
* **Output:** Same as input

Parameters
----------

* **HTML:** The source code of your HTML. You can use workflow variables here, in order to build a template that gets expanded dynamically when the workflow is run.
* **Title:** Sets the title of the `Preview` tab while your custom HTML is shown. This has to be relatively short if you don't want it to be truncated.
* **Base URL:** Used for loading relative image references, links etc. Can be left empty if you only use absolute URLs.
