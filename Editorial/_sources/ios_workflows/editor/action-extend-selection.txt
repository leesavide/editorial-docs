.. _workflow-action-extend-selection:

================
Extend Selection
================

*Extends the current text selection to the left or right*

This action's effect is similar to dragging the two selection handles in the editor. You can also extend the selection to the start/end of the current line/paragraph or the entire document.

* **Input:** Not used
* **Output:** The selected text

Parameters
----------

* **Direction:** Can be `Backward`, `Forward`, or `Both`. Additionally, you can specify how far the selection should be extended. This can be the start/end of the document, the start/end selected of line(s) or a number of characters.
* **Number of Characters:** If the `number of characters` option is used above, this last parameter specifies by how many characters the selection should be extended. This field can contain either a plain number, or a mathematical expression like ``5 + 2``. You can also use variables here. If the number is negative, this has the same effect as using the opposite direction with a positive number.
