==============================
Convert Multi-Markdown to HTML
==============================

*Converts Multi-Markdown text (given as input) to HTML*

The *Preview* panel uses the same kind of conversion, but the output of this action doesn't include any (CSS) styling by default.

You can use the *Template* parameter to build a complete HTML document that can include placeholders for metadata headers, e.g. ``{{META:Title}}``.

The ``{{CONTENT}}`` placeholder in the template is replaced with the actual HTML code. While you should usually keep it, it is also possible to use this action to extract only metadata headers (see above), and not convert the actual document.

For more information about the Multi-Markdown syntax, please see the `MultiMarkdown Syntax Guide <https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide>`_ by Fletcher T. Penney.

* **Input:** The Multi-Markdown source text
* **Output:** The converted HTML
