.. _workflow-action-condition:

================================
Conditional Block (If...Then...)
================================

*Runs the contained block of actions only if a condition is met.*

You might have actions in your workflow that only make sense if text is selected or if the clipboard is not empty. By putting these actions inside a conditional block, you can make them run only under the intended circumstances.

To make an action part of the conditional block, simply drag it between the `If…` item and the `…End If` part.

If the condition is not met, the workflow continues after the `…End If` item.

When you tap the `Hide Actions` button, all actions inside the conditional block and the `…End If` item are collapsed. This allows you to drag the entire block into a different conditional block to create nested conditions, or to save the block as a preset.

* **Input:** Gets passed to either the first action within the block, or the next action after `…End If`
* **Output:** Same as input

Parameters
----------

* **Condition:** The parameter consist of two text values that are compared using the given method (`is Equal to`, `is Not Equal to`, `Contains`, `Doesn't Contain`, or `Matches Regular Expression`). The text fields will usually contain variable placeholders.
