********************************
Scripting Editorial with Python
********************************

You can extend Editorial with your own commands using simple drag'n'drop workflows (see :ref:`ios-workflows`). Workflows can also include scripts as a :ref:`workflow-action-run-script` or :ref:`workflow-action-custom` action, which enables you to create more complex workflows that wouldn't be possible with the built-in actions alone.

When you use the :ref:`workflow-action-run-script` action in a workflow, the script is shown in a mini editor within the workflow view, but you can switch to a full-screen full-screen editor by tapping the `Full Editor` button next to the code. The full-screen editor has several features that aren't available in the mini editor, for example auto-completion and a built-in UI editor (for use with the :mod:`ui` module).

For more detailed information about how you can combine workflows with scripts, please read the documentation about the :ref:`workflow-action-run-script` and the :mod:`workflow` Python module.
