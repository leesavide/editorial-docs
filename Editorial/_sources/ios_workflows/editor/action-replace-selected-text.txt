The extended keyboard for the *Replacement Text* parameter contains an additional button to set the selection within the inserted text. When you tap it, a special placeholder is inserted that marks the caret position. You can also mark an entire range to be selected after insertion -- simply select it before tapping the button. This can be useful if you want to insert text that you might want to overwrite immediately.

* **Input:** Can be used as a variable in the `Replacement Text` parameter
* **Output:** The replacement text

Parameters
----------

* **Replacement Text:** The text that the selection should be replaced with. If the selection is empty, the text is inserted at the position of the caret.
