Writing Todo Lists
------------------

Editorial supports the TaskPaper format for writing todo lists in plain text. The format was invented by Jesse Grosjean for the eponymous `TaskPaper app <http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper>`_. By default, TaskPaper files have a .taskpaper extension, but you can also edit other files in TaskPaper mode by selecting it as the syntax mode in the Quick Settings ("Aa") panel.

The TaskPaper Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TaskPaper "markup" is very simple: To create a task, just start a line with a dash and a following space.::

    - This is a task 

The dash is automatically converted to a checkbox in Editorial -- this doesn't change the underlying plain text file at all, it is just a convenience for marking tasks as done more quickly.

Tasks can be tagged, using the '@' symbol.::

    - Another task @home

It's generally up to you what you use tags for (if you use them at all) -- you might have different tags for contexts, places, people, etc.

The special @done tag is used to mark finished tasks.::

    - A finished task @done(2015-02-21)

Tags can contain additional information, in this case the completion date in parentheses, which is added automatically when you use the checkboxes in Editorial.

To insert a project header, simply type a line that ends with a colon (':'). Everything that isn't a task or project header is considered a note.

Color Labels
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Editorial's :ref:`settings`, you can associate tags with color labels. Some tags, like @due, @flagged, and @today have default colors, but you can easily change this.

If a task has multiple tags that you've assigned color labels to, the actual label is determined by the order of the tags on the line. The last tag "wins". The @done tag has a clear color label by default -- marking a task as done adds the @done tag at the end, so it clears all other color labels without needing to remove the colored tags.

Folding Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By tapping on the triangle next to a project header, you can *fold* the project, i.e. hide its tasks from view, without deleting anything.

When a project is folded, the number of hidden tasks is shown in a small label next to the header. You can tap this label or the triangle to unfold the project.

Moving Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you're editing TaskPaper documents, you'll notice that each line contains a gray rectangle in the right margin. You can tap and hold this to move a task up or down. When a project is folded (see above), you can also use this mechanism to move the entire project.

You can also use this method of rearranging lines in other (non-TaskPaper) documents by enabling the "Arrange Paragraphs" options in the quick settings ("Aa") panel.

.. tip::
    When a project is folded (see above), you can move it together with all its tasks.
