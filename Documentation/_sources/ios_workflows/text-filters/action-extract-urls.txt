.. _workflow-action-extract-urls:

=================
Extract URLs
=================

*Finds URLs in the input and outputs each on a separate line*

The URLs do not necessarily have to be fully-qualified URLs, so things like "google.com" are recognized, even though the protocol part is missing. The output is always a complete URL, so in this example it would be "http://google.com".

For email addresses, the output has the form "mailto:john.appleseed@example.com".

The output uses a separate line for each URL that is found, so it's suitable as input to a :ref:`workflow-action-select-from-list` action.

* **Input:** Text that contains URLs
* **Output:** All URLs in the input text, one per line

Parameters
----------

This action has no configurable parameters.
